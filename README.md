# Lovelace Lightning Detector Card

![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]

We are working on a new Lovelace card for depicting lightning in your local area as shown by your own inexpensive sensor.  Here are what we think the card will look like.

NOTE: this is our initial mockup. We'll see how close we get over time. 

### Sensor for this card

You buy an AS3935 sensor and attach it to a Raspberry Pi and the software for communicating the sensor data to home assistant can be found in at [lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon](https://github.com/ironsheep/lightning-detector-MQTT2HA-Daemon) project.
